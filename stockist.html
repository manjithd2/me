				<h4>A wedding card retailer app</h4>

        <div class="ux-content">
          <p>One morning, I was contacted about a project involving a problem faced by the vendors. This is my story of my approach to solving a problem about an industry I knew nothing about.</p>

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            When a retailer shows wedding cards to a client, he is usually unaware of it’s availability in stock unless and otherwise enquired about it by the customer or during his seasonal stock checkups. This not only affects his sales but also the customer who doesn’t get the desired wedding card design. 
          </p>

          <h3>Understanding the process</h3>
          <p>Since I had no prior knowledge of how the industry fuctions, I got down to do some research to find the pain points that were having direct impact on the problem.</p>
          <p>When a customer selects a card at a Wedding card shop, the retailer confirms the availability of the card by making a call to the warehouse, where an inventory manager turns the pages of his dusty book to check the stock of the card. This process ranges from minutes to hours to even a day! This means problems for two parties, one being the customer who has to wait and in the worst case be informed about the unavailability of the card after a day! The other party being the inventory manager who needs to find the card, but that’s his job (can this be made more easier? ). On an average day, a inventory manager deals with 100 - 400 orders. Now, that's a large number and to deal with that is surely an herculean task.</p>

          <img class="img-responsive" src="images/stockist/workflow.jpg">

          <h3>Problem's in the process</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Collectively an offline process, requires manpower.</li>
            <li>Difficult for the inventory manager to keep track of all orders.</li>
            <li>Slow search time.</li>
            <li>Time consuming for the customer.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Understanding the user</h3>
          <p>
              Mahesh is a 35 year old card retailer, who has inherited his shop from his father. He is not a  graduate and he spends most of his time chatting with his friends when not attending to customers. Despite being a major player in the wedding card industry he hasn’t achieved 100% conversion rate from his customers. He spends most of his time in his shop and his day starts by cleaning cards and attending calls from the warehouse which supplies cards informing him about the cards that are out of stock. The warehouse supplies cards to other retailers also.
              <b>Goals</b> Increase conversion rate and customer satisfaction.<br>
              <b>Frustration</b> the everyday routine of calling the warehouse about the out of stock cards, in order to not lose customer because of unavailability of card.
          </p>

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Looking at the exisiting process, I tried to eliminate the need of the retailer to depend on the inventory manager for checking the availability of the card. Instead of having a fully offline process it was more benefecial if the whole inventory was shifted to the cloud. This would mean that the retailer would be able to check the availabilty of the card and also eliminate the routine calls to the inventory manager.
          </p>
